# NumCPP
#### A Matrices-centered library built for C++ and power-boosted by OpenCL.
###### Each Matrix object supports multiple Matrix-on-Matrix operations and Matrix-on-Scalar operations.
###### The matrices also support broadcasting (similar to NumPy).

#### Supported Operations
###### Matrix-on-Scalar operations: +, -, *, <, <=, ==, >=, >, ^
###### Matrix-on-Matrix (element-wise) operations: +, -, *, <, <=, ==, >
